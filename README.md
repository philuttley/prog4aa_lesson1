# Programming for Astronomy and Astrophysics: Lesson 1

An introduction to Python for non-programmers.

## About the Lesson

This lesson is based primarily on material from the [Software Carpentry Lessons][SWC] 
[Programming with Python][SWC-PWP] and [Plotting and Programming in Python][SWC-PPP],
along with contributions from the teachers of the course Programming for Astronomy
and Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam.

The lesson teaches novice programmers to write modular code to perform data analysis
using Python. The emphasis, however, is on teaching language-agnostic principles of
programming such as automation with loops and encapsulation with functions,
see [Best Practices for Scientific Computing][best-practices] and
[Good enough practices in scientific computing][good-practices] to learn more.

The main example used in this lesson analyses a set of 12 files with simulated inflammation
data collected from a trial for a new treatment for arthritis. Learners are shown
how it is better to automate analysis using functions instead of repeating analysis
steps manually.
